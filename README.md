SpreePlugins
============

This Spree extension enables Spree storefront owners to add custom scripts and features as plugins to products.

Installation
------------

Add spree_plugins to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_plugins'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_plugins:install
```

Examples
--------
[**share-button**](https://github.com/carrot/share-button)
	1. Make a new plugin in the Configurations menu of admin
	2. Download and copy the script from the [Github page](https://github.com/carrot/share-button) as code for this new plugin.
	3. Activate then save the plugin.
	(4.) Optional: include a custom css class to position the plugin to your liking on the product page.

[**addThis**](https://www.addthis.com/)
	1. Setup an account with [addthis.com](https://www.addthis.com/)
	2. Copy and paste their div and script tag into the code for a new plugin
	3. Activate and save the plugin.

Customize
----------
To customize your css class, follow the instructions [here](http://guides.spreecommerce.com/developer/asset.html) to add a custom css class. 

To customize where in the DOM you'd like the div and script tag to be inserted, you can add this jQuery script to the plugin's code to specify a DOM element to add the plugin scripts to:
```
$($('#[plugin_name]_plugin').detach()).appendTo([SELECTOR_FOR_YOUR_DOM_ELEMENT]);
```

For example, the code to put the addThis plugin into the footer, would be:
```$($('#add_this_plugin').detach()).appendTo('#footer');```

**note**: The id for your plugin's div is defaulted to `[plugin_name]_plugin`

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_plugins/factories'
```
